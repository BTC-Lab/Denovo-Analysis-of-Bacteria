Denovo Analysis of Bacteria    
A bioinformatics pipeline for performing De novo genome assembly and analysis of bacteria from raw sequencing data. This project is designed to assist researchers and microbiologists in reconstructing bacterial genomes without a reference.  
The Bioinformatics analysis pipeline for the De novo genome assembly is shown below.   
  
Briefly perform the following analysis      
  
  •  	Fastq quality checking and filtering  
  •	  De novo genome assembly  
  •  	Gene prediction  
  •	  Gene annotation
